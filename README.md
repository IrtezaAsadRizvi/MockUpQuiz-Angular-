# MockUpQuiz-Angular-

This web application is a real time quiz system that uses some advance web technology
(ajax,angular) to load ,execute and evaluate a full quiz system as fast as possible. The
project is built on angularJS which is popular for its revolutionary two way data binding
mechanism. The home page (index.html) includes the study material for the exam. The
user can find some more information about each item in the study material section just
by clicking ‘Learn more’, that’s how convenient the app is. Finally the user would click
the start quiz button to start the quiz. All the data in our app is loaded with JSON which
is the fastest way to load and send data from host to host. The questions would load
real time using the combination of ajax and $index binding of angular. The questions
continues with a single click on the continue button generated bellow. The thing that
makes our quiz app unique is how fast and light weight this is. Each and every operation
is loaded and executed with condition from the previous operation. So No extra features
load unless called upon meaning the initial system is light-weight and fast one to load.
