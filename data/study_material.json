These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the Sun that did not show the disc of a planet and was not observed to have the characteristics of an active comet. As minor planets in the outer Solar System were discovered and found to have volatile-based surfaces that resemble those of comets, they were often distinguished from asteroids of the asteroid belt.[1] In this article, the term 'asteroid' refers to the minor planets of the inner Solar System including those co-orbital with Jupiter.",
